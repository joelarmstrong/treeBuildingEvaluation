# treeBuildingEvaluation

A set of scripts to evaluate the accuracy of gene trees in a [HAL](https://github.com/glennhickey/hal) file.

To build, change the variable `CACTUS_DIR` in the Makefile to the location of a [cactus](https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus) installation. Cactus's submodules must be locally updated and compiled.
